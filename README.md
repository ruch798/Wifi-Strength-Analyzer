# Wifi-Strength-Analyzer

Signal strength reading in dBm displayed on the Status screen of an Android phone. At -107 dBm, that’s a pretty weak signal. It’s often useful to know how strong a signal your cell phone is receiving at a specific moment. Perhaps you’re trying to make a call but it won’t go through to the intended recipient. Or maybe texts, emails or posts hit your in-box hours after they were sent. In cases like these, knowing your signal strength can help you determine why you didn’t get the service you expected. Of course all phones have the “bars” graphic that are displayed on the home screen. The problem with the ubiquitous bars representation is that there are no fixed standards. The accuracy of the bars graphic can vary widely between phone models, devices from different manufacturers, and operating systems.

Key functions:
- Wifi gets enabled if it has been disabled
- Calculation on tapping the calculate button, output being displayed on the screen and stored in a file
